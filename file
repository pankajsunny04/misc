What is the deployment strategy for the application on AKS?

Will you be using Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, or any other tools?

How will the application handle scaling? Are there any auto-scaling configurations in place?

Will there be multiple replicas of the application pods for high availability?

What strategies will be used for updating the application (e.g., rolling updates, canary deployments)?

How will liveness and readiness probes be configured for the application pods?

What endpoints or checks will be used for these probes?

What is the expected growth rate of compute and storage requirements?

How will EFS be integrated with the AKS cluster?

Will you use CSI drivers for EFS, and if so, how will they be configured?

Will you be using the Amazon EFS CSI driver for integration?

What performance mode (e.g., General Purpose, Max I/O) will be used for EFS?

How will the throughput and I/O performance be managed and optimized?

What performance metrics can we expect from the EFS setup?

Are there any specific performance tuning recommendations?

How will data be managed within EFS?

How will application configurations be managed (ConfigMaps, Secrets)?

Are there any stateful components in the application that require persistent storage?

How will stateful applications be managed in the AKS cluster?

How will application-level logging and monitoring be handled?

Will there be any specific logging agents or monitoring tools used (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)?
